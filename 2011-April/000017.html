<PRE>Hi,

I didn't notice that comparing my patch file with the new star source.
Care to enlighten me as to where the typo was? :)

Yes, I posted about that to the lzip-bug mailing list a while ago, see
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/lzip-bug@nongnu.org/msg00273.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/lzip-bug@nongnu.org/msg00273.html</A>

For me, lzip took about 2.5 times longer than xz to compress one test
file. And while I can comfortably use xz with a dictionary size of 256MB
on my system, lzip aborted with an out-of-memory error when I attempted to
use that size. I'm not sure why there is such a large performance
difference. Maybe lzip is based on an older version of the LZMA SDK???

One apparent advantage of the lzip format compared to xz is for use in
embedded systems; the lzip file format is simpler than xz so decompression
code can be smaller.

But based on my testing, I'm currently using xz in preference to lzip on
my PC.


&gt;<i> The decompression time seems to be comparable and lzip again needs only
</I>&gt;<i> half the RAM xz like to have, so this may be an argument.
</I>
That difference may have been due to different default dictionary sizes
used by lzip vs xz. Try comparing the memory usage when both are using the
same dictionary size.


&gt;<i> The licensce of lzip is a problem as it is unclear whether the code
</I>&gt;<i> may be used as a built in library for arbitrary projects.
</I>
The lzlib (and lzip) license is the GNU GPL v3.

However, pdlzip can compress and decompress lzip format and is public domain:
  <A HREF="http://lzip.nongnu.org/pdlzip.html">http://lzip.nongnu.org/pdlzip.html</A>
Also easylzma is public domain:
  <A HREF="http://lloyd.github.com/easylzma/">http://lloyd.github.com/easylzma/</A>


&gt;<i> The interesting thing seems to be that both xz and lzip claim to be a
</I>&gt;<i> descendent frm LZMA. Do you have more information on this?
</I>
The original LZMA SDK is public domain, so developers can modify it or
incorporate code from it into their projects regardless of the license
they use for their software.

XZ Utils is mostly public domain, while lzip and lzlib are distributed
under the GNU GPL version 3. As mentioned above there are public domain
libraries which can be used to implement lzip support.
