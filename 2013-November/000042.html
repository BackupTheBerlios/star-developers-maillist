Well, I know that one reason for withdrawing the POSIX ACL draft in October 
1997 was that the POSIX draft was too simple and did not implement what people 
like to see.

I am still wondering whether it is possible to implement an aproximation that 
could be better than not having a reverse conversion at all.

I would expect that an NFSv4 ACL that does not make use from deny type entries 
and that does not use the other permissions from NFSv4 ACLs should have a good 
chance for a not too bad conversion. Maybe this kind of conversion could be 
made optional via a star command line switch....

</I>&gt;<i> This did not stop the Linux NFSv4 server from doing it. To my knowledge,
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux NFSv4 implementation does not properly preserve the semantics.
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. There are situations where the NFSv4 ACLs that you get back from
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux NFSv4 server do not match what you set.
</I>
I was asking in hope to get knowledge whether there is a free implementation 
for this kind of conversion.

&gt;<i> &gt; I selected ACL_COMPACT_FMT as it tends to create slightly shorter strings.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are there any objections or forseeable problems for the future?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You might want to read the link that I provided above.
</I>
Did you see problems mentioned in that ietf paper?
I just die a coarse read during last weekend so far...


&gt;<i> I don't know of any library that does what you want. There was an
</I>&gt;<i> extension of NFSv4 ACLs called Richacls that attempted two combine the
</I>&gt;<i> two ACL implementations. However, conversion only worked one way:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.bestbits.at/richacl/">http://www.bestbits.at/richacl/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that being said, you will likely need to handle NFSv4 ACLs and
</I>&gt;<i> POSIX ACLs independently. Since only 1 ACL implementation is active at a
</I>&gt;<i> time, you could probably have a bit to indicate which of the two is used.
</I>
Are you talking about Linux here?

Given the fact that FreeBSD and Linux did implement a sufficiently identical 
library for POSIX draft ACLs in the past, I am in hope, we could arrange the 
same for NFSv4 ACLs. So it would be nice if platforms besides Solaris did 
either pick up the libsec interface for both POSIX draft ACLs and NFSv4 ACLs or 
implement a compatible enhenced version of their previous POSIX draft ACL 
library.

BTW: I tried to contact Andreas before but did not get a reply yet.

For the POSIX draft -&gt; NFSv4 conversion, people could use the code from 
OpenSolaris libsec:
