<PRE>I'm in the planning stages of a project to make some changes to Sun 
SAM-FS.  Namely, we're looking to move to a newer/more standard tar 
format for tape archiving.  I've been looking at doing this by moving to 
either the newest GNU format, or the star format, as both of these are 
supported by 3rd parties outside of Sun.  The immediate goal of the 
project is to get the size and name/linkname into the standard PAX 
headers, later we'll need to support ACLs as well.

Because the star format supports ACLs, and the GNU tar format does not, 
I'm leaning towards recommending the star format.  However, I wanted to 
inquire about how star supports sparse files that are larger than 8 GB.  
The documentation of the star format 
(<A HREF="http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/man/star/star.4.html">http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/man/star/star.4.html</A>) seems to 
indicate that star handles sparse regions with the following struct:

struct sparse {
    char t_offset[12];
    char t_numbytes[12];
};


This brings up the question of how star handles sparse regions with 
offsets or lengths greater than 8GB.  I was wondering if the 
documentation is out of date, or if star is currently unable to sparse 
regions in very large files.

Thanks,

Eric Diven
