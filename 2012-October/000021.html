<PRE>Hi,

In March 2011 I posted a patch to star-developers to implement the
-force-hole option for archive creation; see
  <A HREF="../2011-March/000005.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/star-developers/2011-March/000005.html</A>

That patch causes star to scan all files, not just sparse files, for
all-zero regions, and store all files as sparse in the archive. The
advantage of that is, non-sparse files with all-zero regions &quot;waste&quot; less
space in the archive, and extracting those files (as sparse files) is
faster. Those changes were incorporated into recent star versions
available from
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/</A>


It turns out there some minor issues with the patch I posted:

1. When -force-hole -sparse is specified, *all* non-sparse files are
stored as sparse. Even when the file has no all-zero regions, a sparse
header is written to the archive. So the archive size is increased by 512
bytes unnecessarily. If archiving thousands of files with no all-zero
regions (e.g. text files, JPEG images, compressed files etc.), that can
increase the archive size significantly.

There might also be interchange issues, where some older tar
implementations are unable to extract any files from the archive. (Though
if the user specified -force-hole they should be aware of that possibility
anyway.)

2. If a file has exactly one 512-byte all-zero region, star may as well
store it as non-sparse, because the added sparse header cancels out the
512 bytes saved from storing as sparse.

3. star is a bit too noisy, printing &quot;Treating [filename] as sparse&quot; for
every non-sparse file. Since the user specified -force-hole they probably
know that already. :)


So I have developed an alternative patch, attached to this message, which
has these changes:

1. Only store non-sparse files as sparse if (size of all-zero regions) &gt;
512 bytes
2. Only print &quot;Treating [filename] as sparse&quot; for files which have more
than 512 bytes all-zero region.

You should be able to apply the patch to star as in
   <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/schily-2012-06-10.tar.bz2">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/schily-2012-06-10.tar.bz2</A>

I haven't tested the patch much yet.


Regards,
-- Mark
